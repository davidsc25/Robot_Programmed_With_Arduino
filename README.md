At the age of 17, I carried out this project as my first experience in programming for my High School Research Project. My goal was to learn from scratch and overcome the challenge of designing and building a fully functional robot using **Arduino**.

The research project focuses on robotics and programming through the use of Arduino. The main motivation stemmed from my interest in technology, particularly the ability to program robots to perform specific tasks.

The development of the project required significant personal effort and dedication, especially during the summer, as my initial knowledge was quite basic.

The work is structured into three main sections:

1. **Components Used**: Theoretical description of the parts employed, including their characteristics and functionality.
2. **Robot Assembly**: Detailed documentation of the assembly process.
3. **Programming**: Development of the code uploaded to the Arduino UNO board.

Additionally, as a complement to the project, I recorded an explanatory video for **YouTube**, showcasing the steps followed in building the robot. This experience was not only enriching but also allowed me to understand the importance of video editing in creating quality content.

Project Objectives:

- Learn the basics of **programming** with Arduino, progressing from simple tasks (such as turning on an LED) to remote control of the robot.
- Deepen my understanding of **robotics** through practical application.
- Ensure the robot functions correctly and explore possible improvements in its **design**.

In conclusion, this project not only met its initial objectives but also allowed me to develop technical and personal skills that will be highly useful in the future.
